## Set Up Development Org

- Create a new Trailhead Playground for this superbadge. Using this org for any other reason might create problems when validating the challenge. If you choose to use a development org, make sure you deploy My Domain to all the users. The package you will install has some custom lightning components that only show when My Domain is deployed.
- In the `Setup > Security > Session Settings` section, disable the component cache by deactivating the setting for `Enable secure and persistent browser caching to improve performance`. This allows you to see your changes right after you deploy your code, without delays caused by component cache.
- Install this [unlocked package](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t6g000008av9iAAA) (package ID: 04t6g000008ateoAAA). This package contains metadata you'll use to complete this challenge. If you have trouble installing this package, follow the steps in the [Install a Package or App to Complete a Trailhead Challenge](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/help?article=Installing-a-package-or-app-to-complete-a-Trailhead-challenge) help article.
Challenges of super Specialist

## Challenge 1

Quiz: Credential Security
Answer questions about superbadge credentials and the Trailhead Credential and Certification Program. Please review the Superbadge Challenge Help article for information about the Salesforce Certification Program information and Superbadge Code of Conduct.

## Challenge 2

Before you start
Complete all of the prework, including the installation of the unlocked package. Once you click the button, this step will also pre-populate the boat data in your playground.

Before you begin the challenges, review the Lightning Web Components Specialist: Trailhead Challenge Help knowledge article. Also, read the requirements and the scenario entirely. They are presented in a certain order, to simulate a real-life situation, and you have to identify the dependencies between the components. We recommend developing the components in the order that the challenges are checked.

Since Lightning Web Components use a case-sensitive language, make sure you are applying the correct case in your code.
